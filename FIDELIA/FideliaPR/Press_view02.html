														Cilia Boes who was a former CHRISTIAN DIOR top swimsuit, lingerie top designer, explains about ‘FIDELIA by Cilia Boes’s brand product which launches on Dec 4th at Chosun Hotel, Chung-gu, Seoul on Dec 3rd.
													</strong><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>

													CJ O Shopping scouted Cilia Boes(photo) who worked CHRISTIAN DIOR top designer last December and her role was a creative director as managing overall position for lingerie brand ‘FIDELIA’. It was a shock that domestic home shopping company scouted a person who came from Paris, the birthplace of fashion.<br/><br/>

													From making a high priced luxury to designing home shopping product could feel awkward and Boes told the main interview “Decreasing the price does not mean giving up a luxury design” and “All the more, luxurious exclusive sensitivity could enjoy for general consumers with rational price”.<br/><br/>

													She graduated from textile design vocational school in Paris and originally dreamed as a shoes designer. Her mother was a famous garmet cutter of CHANEL and PRINCESSE TAMTAM and her father was lingerie manufacturer, so it was familiar background for lingerie since she was young, but more interested in shoes.<br/><br/>

													At that period, CHRISTIAN DIOR scouted a designer in lingerie field not for shoes. Boes submitted a portfolio for swimsuit design using shoes form and that captured John Galliano who was a top designer named by ‘CHRISTIAN DIOR’s Legend’. She managed overall for swimsuit and lingerie at CHRISTIAN DIOR.<br/><br/>

													She told “Shoes and lingerie are not always a good product as an unconditional beauty” and “Both products and design would require a lots of technology and that gave John Galliano as his favor for engrafting these together and giving a new idea.<br/><br/>

													After, Boes produced lingerie by skin for 10 years and got a name by all sorts of fashion show through various swimsuit and lingerie and resigned as CHRISTIAN DIOR shut up shop in lingerie industry last year in October. And then she was scouted by CJ O Shopping and made an exhibit at FIDELIA’s Paris international lingerie show and launched ‘FIDELIA by Cilia Boes’ putting up her own name based on her exhibition work on 4th.<br/><br/>

													Boes got mainly inspired by arabesque pattern of building terrace in Paris, France and will come up with works which were inspired by rich background and clothes of French King Louis XVI’s wife Marie Antoinette at international lingerie show next year. She told “Antoinette gave a huge influence on French clothes for wearing clothes of cotton material in which nobles did not usually wear at that period” and “Having an eye on this, the material would be based on white cotton and will show off design using a new pattern living at palace’s curtain, carpet and garden of Versailles.
